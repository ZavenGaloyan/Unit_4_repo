 # Criteria A: Planning:
 ## Problem definition
My client is a grade 11 student that studying the International Baccalaureate diploma program at their school. Despite them having access to numerous online resources, they and there pear students often struggle to find a supportive community of memebers who can help them study effectively and navigate their individual academic challenges. This casues them to often feel isolated and overwhelmed at times of adversity, particularly when studying alone, which can negatively impact their motivation, learning goals, and in some cases their mental health. Thus the client wishes there was a way for a networking website that connects students and provides a platform for collaborative learning, discussion, and social interaction which can help the them and their peers at the problems they're facing. They would like the platform  to allow students in some way to create profiles, join groups based on their interests and areas of study to better cater to individual needs, participate in online discussions, share resources and study materials, and collaborate on projects and assignments all in one program. The client believes that if all the needs are met that it will foster a sense of community, allowing for their and others academic growth and engagement, and general improvement in academic performance.
 ## Proposed Solution
 To Create a social network for the client and there school using python, html, and css along with sql databases. It will have seperate pages based off of classes a certain individual takes. These pages will allow students to communicate with their peers and share resources. They can also create their own groups to which their peers can join if they need to complete a project or group task. 
 ## Success Criteria
 
1. Allow users to create accounts and login in there repsective accounts

2. Allow users to create specific academic groups

3.Allow users to chat bettween eachother and in relative groups using a posting method

4.Allow for users to upload and share resources

5.Integrate a resources page based off interests 

 ## Rationale for Proposed Soultion
Based off the clients requests and success criteria that have decided upon the next step is the development of such social network. For doing so I have decided on using Flask as the web framework, html as the standard markup language, and css as the sheet style language. These particular tools have been chosen to build the the social netowork due to their appealing traits.

Flask which is written in python syntax is a lightweight web framework that allows for developers to easily and quickly build web application with a wide range of features fexibility. This is particulary apealing for such a program due to the clients time constraint and relativly simple requirments and needs. This is better than many other web frameworks that are more complicated and require more time for development

HTML was chosen as the standard markup language for this particualr project as it is considered the industry standard for any programs that are build for web browsers. Due to its popularity it means that it is widly supported acoross many web browsers and has many online resoureces to help increase the speed of development and functionality of the social network for the client.

CSS similarly to the reason was HTML is being used CSS is the most popular method for styling formating of websites. Its vast possiblitiyes of custimization allow for any of the clients needs to be met accordingly. Also the ease of integrating CSS with HTML will allow for developers to easily and effectivly meet specific requirments of thge client.

By using Flask, HTML, and CSS I as a developer will have full control over all of the aspects of the program allowing me to fully meet any of the clients requirments in terms of design and functionality. While not comprimising on time constrains or developer setbacks that may occur if other methods were to be used.
